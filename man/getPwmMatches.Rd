\title{Find all PWM matches within an XStringSet}
\usage{
getPwmMatches(pwm, stringset, rc = TRUE, min_score = "80\%", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{pwm}{A Position Weight Matrix}

\item{stringset}{An XStringSet}

\item{rc}{logical(1) Also find matches using the reverse complement of pwm}

\item{min_score}{The minimum score to return a match}

\item{...}{Passed to \link[Biostrings]{matchPWM}}
}
\value{
A DataFrame with columns: `seq`, `start`, `end`, `width`, `match`,
`score` and `direction`
The first four columns indicate the position of the match within the query
stringset, whilst `match` returns the matching sequence as an `XStringSet`.
The `direction` column denotes `F` and `R` as a forward or reverse match
respectively
}
\description{
Find all PWM matches within a set of sequences
}
\details{
Taking a set of sequences as an XStringSet, find all matches above the
supplied score (i.e. threshold) for a single Position Weight Matrix (PWM),
generally representing a transcription factor binding motif.
By default, matches are performed using the PWM as provided and the reverse
complement, however this can easily be disable by setting `rc = FALSE`.

The function relies heavily on \link[Biostrings]{matchPWM} and
\link[IRanges]{Views} for speed.
